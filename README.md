# Uninformed (and informed) search methods
This repository (as part of the COMP6231 Foundations of AI module) contains basic implementation of the following types of search: depth first, breadth first, iterative deepening 
and A* heuristic search to solve the __Blocksworld problem__. It is being examined how the time to reach 
the solution (or a solution of a given quality) increases/scales-up with problem size/difficulty (solution depth). 

- ```a_star.py```, ```bfs.py```, ```dfs.py``` and ```ids.py``` contain implementation of the algorithms
- ```action.py``` contains functions related to agent's moves
- ```plot.py``` returns plots for the time and space complexity of the algorithms
- ```blocksworld_tile_puzzle.pdf``` contains the problem desctiption
